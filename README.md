# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## Description


This project provides a set of Python functions to perform basic text analysis on a given book or text file. It includes utilities for:

*   **Word Counting**: Determines the total number of words in a text.
*   **Character Frequency Analysis**: Counts the occurrences of each alphabetic character, case-insensitively.
*   **Data Transformation**: Converts raw character counts into a more structured format (e.g., a list of dictionaries).

The primary goal is to demonstrate fundamental file handling, string manipulation, dictionary usage, and basic data processing in Python.

## How to Run

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    If your project is on GitHub, use this command to download it:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbdurDRahman/bookbot
    cd bookbot
    ```
    
2.  **Place Your Text File**:
    Ensure the text file you want to analyze (e.g., `books/frankenstein.txt`) is in the correct directory as referenced by your `main.py` script.

3.  **Execute the Script**:
    Run your main Python script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
